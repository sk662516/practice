                NFA refers to Nondeterministic Finite Automaton. DFA refers to Deterministic Finite Automaton. DFA can be best described and understood as one machine. NFA is like multiple small machines that are performing computational activities at the same time. All DFAs are derived from NFAs. The main difference between DFA and NFA, the two classes handling the transition functions of finite automata/ finite automaton theory, impact their behaviour in many ways.
